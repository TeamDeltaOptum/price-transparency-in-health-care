# price-transparency-in-health-care
First of all thanks to OPTUM which gives us opportunity to try our hands in Machine Learning .
This was a great experience to work on an Machine Leaning project with a great team.
It taught us how to  work in team.

Main Idea---------->>>

it is idea based machine learning model
In this model we did not code the whole idea but we give the quick and short preview of our basic idea that will help patients to trust the hospital bills while paying  bills.
Or in simple language we can say that patients will be able to compare their bills with reasonable market prices
And patients can check their diseases before going to hospital it will improve the health care system such as heart diseases and diabetes.
We did our best from our side .
Again Thanks to OPTUM STRATETHON SEASON 4.
